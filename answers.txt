A dying man with art to soothe,
And nothing more important sees
And physic bring with mournful face,
A paragon of virtue he!

But what a nuisance it will be,
Chained to his bedside night and day
If seriously he hath disease
To sigh and meditate alone
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base
