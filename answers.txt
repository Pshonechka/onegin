But what a nuisance it will be,
And physic bring with mournful face,
A paragon of virtue he!
A dying man with art to soothe,
To sigh and meditate alone
Ye need dissimulation base
If seriously he hath disease
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
And nothing more important sees
Chained to his bedside night and day
Without a chance to slip away.
